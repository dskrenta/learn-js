# Comments

Comments are text ignored by the language and often exist periodically to clarify code and make it more readable. It is considered best practice to comment all of your JS code.

You can put comments into JS code:

```
/*
Everything between is a comment.
*/
```

If you comment has no line breaks (on a single line) it is easier to use to forward slashes instead

```
// This is a comment
```
