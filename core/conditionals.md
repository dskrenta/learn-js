# Conditionals

Conditionals are code structures that allow you to test whether an expression returns true or not, and then run different code depending on the result. The most common form of conditionals is the if ... else statements. Example:

```
var name = 'Bill'

if (name === 'Bill') {
  alert('Hey Bill!')
} else {
  alert('Hey you!')
}
```

The expression inside the if statement is the test. This example uses the identity operator which we went over along with the other operators. Try playing around with if ... else statements with different operators. The main purpose of conditionals is to perform specific actions for specific decisions.
