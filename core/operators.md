# Operators

An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values or variables. Note that this is not a complete list of operators, the complete list can be found in the advanced section of this book.

Operator | Explanation | Symbol(s) | Example
--- | --- | --- | ---
add/concatenation | Add two numbers or strings together | + | ``` 6 + 9; 'hello' + 'world!';```
subtract, multiply, divide | These do what you would expect them to do (basic math)| -, \*, / | ```8 - 3; 8 * 7; 9 / 3;```
assignment | You have seen this already in the variables section | = | ```myVar = 'Bill'```
identity | Does a test to see if two values or variables hold the same value and the same type, returns true/false (Boolean) | === | ```3 === 3```
negation | Returns logically opposite of what it precedes: example if true then false | ! | ```!(3 === 3) // returns false```
not equal | Tests whether two values or variables are not equal | !=== | ```'bill' !=== 'bob' // returns true```
